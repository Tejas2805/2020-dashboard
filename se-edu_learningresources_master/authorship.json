She then clicks on a hyperlink on the site to go to the URL `www.example-bank.com/transfer` to perform her transaction. Note that Alice does not have to enter her username and password again, but the bank still knows that the request is made by her. This is done through a mechanism of the HTTP protocol called a [HTTP Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies). A *cookie* is a small piece of information that is sent along with all HTTP requests to a particular website. In our case, after receiving Alice\u0027s credentials for logging in, the bank instructs Alice\u0027s browser to store a *cookie* `auth\u003d1abcd2ek3292fsa390sdf` and **send this cookie together with every subsequent request** to `www.example-bank.com`. Thus, once the web server sees this cookie in the request, it knows that this is an authenticated request from Alice. Many websites use this cookie mechanism so that users only have to log in once."
